          "My name is Arthur Fileti Fiorette, i'm a software engineer based in Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. I'm passionate about building software that improves the peoples lives. I'm a fan of the open source community and I'm always looking for new projects to contribute to.",
          "I'm still 17, but i am dedicated to fullstack development. I started programming somewhere in late 2018 with Java, while trying at my best to code some Minecraft plugins, today I've developed entire SaaS applications, from small to big projects.",
          "Nowadays I am working half-time as a software engineer at an local company, while going to high school at Federal Institute of EspÃ­rito Santo in the other half. Maybe we'll cross paths there.",
          'I am spreading my knowledge between different areas and stages of software development in general. I can manage continuous integration and deployment pipelines, handle multiple repository structures, optimize infrastructures, handle services with docker and have some networking concepts. Despite using Windows on my main machine, I work normally with linux servers and WSL.',
          'Also, I have a good understanding of various web development concepts like caching mechanisms, HTTP protocol, javascript code optimization, experience with NextJS and being a typescript wizard.',
          'Since it all started with me writing my minecraft plugins in java, I know a lot about the java world, especially with the Spring framework and Maven. However, I evolved towards a preference for servers in NodeJS with Typescript, in which, within this vast field, I stood out with the use of GraphQL over Rest and NestJS with Fastify for large monoliths.',
          "For the past few months, I've been experimenting with a new programming language, Rust. Previously, Java was my lowest level programming experience I had. However, I'm loving a lot of the low concepts that Rust brings with it, like concurrency, memory safety, and more. In the near future, I'll probably be playing with Rust in my spare time.",
